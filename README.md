Title: Modelling UK Deprivation (Linear Models + AIC + Diagnostics)

What this is
Builds and compares linear regression models to explain overall deprivation using IMD domain predictors, selects models using AIC, and performs residual/leverage diagnostics to identify unusual districts.

Skills demonstrated
Statistical modelling, model selection (AIC), regression diagnostics, interpretation for policy/business decisions, reproducible analysis.

Methods used
Linear regression, AIC-based comparison/selection, residual and leverage analysis; includes PCA/spatial analysis extensions where relevant.
